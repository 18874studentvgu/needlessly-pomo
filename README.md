# Needlessly Complex Pomodoro
A bash script warper for `zenity` that has no right being this convoluted.

## What is this?
This:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

INTERVAL_1=25
INTERVAL_2=5

zenity \
    --question \
    --title="Pomodoro" \
    --text="Let's start!" \
    --ok-label="Ok ($INTERVAL_1 mins)" || exit

while true; do
    sleep "${INTERVAL_1}m"
    zenity \
        --question \
        --title="Pomodoro" \
        --text="Break time!" \
        --ok-label="Ok ($INTERVAL_2 mins)" || break
    sleep "${INTERVAL_2}m"
    zenity \
        --question \
        --title="Pomodoro" \
        --text="Work time!" \
        --ok-label="Ok ($INTERVAL_1 mins)" || break
done
```
...But the dev just kept on throwing bells and whistles on top of it until the line count exceeded 250! 

## "Features"
### Configurable values
**Like all of them.** Don't like the value of a variable? Override it at your terminal session or in the `.env`.

**Literally infinite intervals.** No arbitrary limits here! 3? 5? 152? 1? Just define more `POMO_INTERVAL_*` variables!

### Desktop integration
Want your pomodoro in your application menu? Your local binary folder? Just run 

### Code by human
~~...which explains all the abominations in here to be honest...~~
All elbow grease. No AI tampering with code here. 

The **[`./resources`](./resources)** folder, on the other hand:

### Randomized Button Labels
...

User extendable too (if you are willing to put up with *the horrors*)
